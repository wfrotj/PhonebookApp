In this project, I took advantages of the following libraries and framework to successfully render my full stack web application in vercel and render.com for my backend.

In my fronend code, I use useState and useEffect to render dynamically the data from my Mongodb and firebase to the DOM.
I also took advantage of tailwind css for ui.
In my backend side, I use express as my ORM and insomnia in testing my different routes for API requests.
I also use jsonwebtoken for creating login feature for my user.
I use bcrypt for creating or hashing the password created by the user.
I made sure all the credentails I use to my firebase and mongodb are hidden using env. and gitignore.
